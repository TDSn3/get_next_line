Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBCs) display lung metastasis tropism. However, the mechanisms underlying this organ-specific pattern remains to be elucidated. We sought to evaluate the utility of blocking extravasation to prevent lung metastasis. To identify potential geminin overexpression-controlled genetic drivers that promote TNBC tumor homing to lungs, we used the differential/suppression subtractive chain (D/SSC) technique. A geminin overexpression-induced lung metastasis gene signature consists of 24 genes was discovered. We validated overexpression of five of these genes (LGR5, HAS2, CDH11, NCAM2, and DSC2) in worsening lung metastasis-free survival in TNBC patients. Our data demonstrate that LGR5-induced β-catenin signaling and stemness in TNBC cells are geminin-overexpression dependent. They also demonstrate for the first-time expression of RSPO2 in mouse lung tissue only and exacerbation of its secretion in the circulation of mice that develop geminin overexpressing/LGR5+-TNBC lung metastasis. We identified a novel extravasation receptor complex, consists of CDH11, CD44v6, c-Met, and AXL on geminin overexpressing/LGR5+-TNBC lung metastatic precursors, inhibition of any of its receptors prevented geminin overexpressing/LGR5+-TNBC lung metastasis. Overall, we propose that geminin overexpression in normal mammary epithelial (HME) cells promotes the generation of TNBC metastatic precursors that home specifically to lungs by upregulating LGR5 expression and promoting stemness, intravasation, and extravasation in these precursors. Circulating levels of RSPO2 and OPN can be diagnostic biomarkers to improve risk stratification of metastatic TNBC to lungs, as well as identifying patients who may benefit from therapy targeting geminin alone or in combination with any member of the newly discovered extravasation receptor complex to minimize TNBC lung metastasis.

Introduction
The median survival for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with lung metastasis is only 22 months [1,2,3]. Metastasis is a function of a small population of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) [4]. The “Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled Receptor 5” a co-receptor for Frizzled/Lrp5/6 receptor complex, is a bona fide marker of adult stem cells in many organs, including the mammary gland (MG) [5, 6]. LGR5 binds members of the roof plate-specific spondin (RSPO) 1–4 family to potentiate Wnt-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity [7]. RSPO2 only is expressed in human lungs [8]. Wnt1, Wnt3a, FZD7, LGR5, and RSPOs overexpression, and β-catenin and its downstream target c-Myc [9] deregulated signaling are all linked to TNBC formation [10,11,12], and increased risk for lung metastases [13, 14]. Osteopontin (OPN) promoter is a target for c-Myc [15]. High circulating OPN level is associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in TNBCs [16]. Inhibiting LGR5, FZD7, or RSPOs markedly suppressed tumor growth in human patient-derived tumor xenograft models [17].

Although OPN promotes tumor progression by binding to integrins and CD44 [18], the main ligand for CD44 is hyaluronan (HA). HA/CD44 signaling promotes proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal changes, and cellular motility [19]. Increased HA level due to deregulation in the HA-synthesizing enzymes, especially HAS2 correlates with poor outcome of patients with basal-like breast cancer [20]. In human, CD44 is encoded by ten constant exons and nine variable exons [21]. The epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1) regulates CD44 splicing [22]. CD44v expression is significantly associated with lung metastasis in breast cancers [23, 24]. CD44v, not CD44/CD44s responds to OPN in the lung environment, where it enhances lung metastasis.

Geminin is overexpressed in ~50% of all breast cancers, especially TNBCs [25, 26]. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, while overexpressed in almost all breast cancer tumors tested, in geminin overexpressing tumors it was exclusively nuclear [25, 26]. Low geminin expressing tumors showed exclusively cytoplasmic c-Abl overexpression [25, 26]. Moreover, we showed earlier that geminin’s oncogenic function is dependent on phosphorylation of geminin tyrosine 150 by nuclear c-Abl [25,26,27,28,29]. We named the geminin/nuclear c-Abl co-overexpression as GemOE [26] and proposed that adding this criterion could stratify TNBC patients who may benefit from a c-Abl specific therapy. Indeed, in our preclinical models, imatinib blocked GemOE-induced transformation in vitro and mammary tumor formation and progression in vivo [26, 29].

Recently, we reported that S100A4 secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) activation of RAGE and Gas6 secreted by M2-tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) activation of AXL on the surface of GemOE cells [30, 31] promoted the invasion and intravasation abilities in GemOE-TNBC tumor cells through exacerbating their stemness, the EMT phenotype, and enhancing expression and functional interaction of an intravasation receptor complex consistent of CD151 and α3β1-integrin [29]. In keeping, orthotopic GemOE tumor formation and lung metastasis were extremely sensitive to anti-c-Abl, anti-RAGE, and anti-AXL drugs [29].

Here, we show that GemOE also drives TNBC cells’ extravasation into the lungs by promoting the expression of a novel receptor complex consists of LGR5, CDH11, CD44v6, c-Met, and AXL. Upregulation of LGR5 on these cells by GemOE triggers their homing to lungs in search of the ligand, RSPO2 overexpressed there. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibiting geminin, or any member of the extravasation complex blocked GemOE/LGR5+-TNBC lung metastasis.

Material and methods
Cell culture
A clone of normal mammary epithelial (HME) cells transfected with a retrovirus expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible geminin allele named Gem9 were used as control HME cells in the absence of Dox, while geminin overexpressing in the presence [32]. Induced Gem9 overexpress geminin at the level seen in TNBC cell lines [32]. Two human TNBC cell lines; MDA-MB-231 (aka. MDA231, HTB-26), MDA-MB-468 (aka. MDA468, HTB-132), one ERα+/luminal A cell line; MCF-7 (HTB-22), and one non-tumorigenic cell line; MCF-10A (CRL-10317) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in 2008. MDA-MB-231-LM2 cells (a subline of MDA-MB-231 is highly metastatic to lung) from Dr. Joan Massagué at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Parental HME, Gem9, and MCF-10A cells are maintained in MEBM medium plus additive in (Lonza Kit Catalog No. CC-3150), except gentamycin-amphotericin B mix, while complemented with 100 ng/ml cholera toxin [32]. The primary (1°) and secondary (2°) geminin-overexpressing cell lines (see below) are maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotics, and 2 µg/ml Dox to maintain the geminin overexpression. MDA231, MDA231LM, MDA468, and MCF-7 cells are maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. All cell lines used in this study were routinely validated using a short tandem repeat (STR) method (detects single base deviations using primer extension) and tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Bioinformatics analysis
The ProgeneV2 prognostic database (http://watson.compbio.iupui.edu/chirayu/proggene/database/?url=proggene) [35], and Kaplan–Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast) [36] were used to analyze the effect of the geminin gene alone or combined with the other genes on breast cancer survival. These databases include the prognostic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases while providing an easy operator interface. The following parameters were selected in the first interface: “GMNN” in single/multiple user input genes; “breast cancer” in cancer type; “overall survival (OS)”, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), or recurrence-free survival (RFS) in survival measure; “median” in “Split patients by”, and 180 months in the “follow up threshold”. In the second interface, “all” the filters were selected, and the plot was created. According to the median expression level of GMNN alone or plus other genes in breast cancer tissues, the patient samples were classified into two groups, higher and lower expression levels. “N” represents the total number of patients included in the specific survival analysis and differ according to the available data. The survival patient information, including 3- and 5-years survival rates were compared using Kaplan–Meier survival curves.

Differential/Suppression subtractive chain (D/SSC)
We used the D/SSC technique described by [37,38,39,40]. This technique is performed to enrich the target, and after the exchange of adapters, a negative subtraction chain eliminated the remaining background. The first-strand synthesis done using 1 µg total RNAs (isolated using TRIzol) in Clontech SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit. Long distant-PCR (20 cycles) synthesized double-strand cDNAs. The Clontech PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit was used to perform the D/SSC using customized primers and adapters as defined in [39], except for the use of four customized primers and adapters as defined in [37,38,39,40]. Tester and driver samples digested then ligated to adapters were PCR amplified for tester-specific fragments using PCR primer in [39]. Subsequently, PCR amplification of tester-specific fragments was performed according to [37,38,39,40]. Procedures for differential hybridization were according to the manufacturer’s instructions except the driver-to-tester ratio in the second hybridization was 2 instead of 1. The primary PCR is 75 °C/5 min then 27 cycles at 94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/1.5 min, while the secondary PCR was the same except for annealing at 65 °C.

Quantitative real-time RT/PCR
In brief, 100 ng of total RNA isolated using TRIzol was used for qRT/PCR using iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) as previously described in [29, 41]. Primer sequences are shown in Suppl. M&M. The qPCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl. The mean Ct of at least triplicate was calculated for each sample and used to determine the ΔCt for this sample as follows: ΔCT = Ct for the gene of interest − Ct of the internal control gene (GAPDH). Then the ΔΔCT was calculated as follows: ΔΔCT = [(Ct for the gene of interest − Ct of the internal control gene, β-actin) for sample A − (Ct for the gene of interest − Ct of the internal control gene (GAPDH) for sample B], where sample B is the calibrator. For the statistical analysis, the ΔΔCT and not the raw Ct data were used. After the run samples were also run on a gel and visualized under UV.

Chromatin, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions purification followed by western blot
To isolate total cellular proteins including those on membrane and chromatin cells were directly sonicated in PBS. To prepare chromatin we used the protocol described earlier[25, 26, 32]. Briefly, at ~75% confluency, cells collected in Buffer A supplemented with 2 mM DTT and 50 µg/ml of digotinin were agitated at 4 °C/10 min then centrifuged in swinging bucket rotor (1500×g/10 min) [26]. Cytoplasmic proteins collected as supernatant, while nuclei containing pellets were resuspended in hypotonic Buffer B with agitation at 4 °C/15 min then layered on top of a 10 ml sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 3500×g/15 min/4 °C [32]. The chromatin pellet was suspended in 0.25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, sonicated, and centrifuged twice at high speed for 10 min/4 °C, and the supernatants were retained. To isolate nuclear vs. cytoplasmic proteins, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, re-suspend in buffer 1 (containing: 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1% NP-40) and incubated 10 min/4 °C with gentle agitation, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at max speed and the supernatant was saved as a cytoplasmic extract. Nuclear pellet was re-suspended in buffer 2 (containing: 20 mM HEPES, 20% Glycerol, 500 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EPTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgCl2); incubated 15 min/4 °C with gentle agitation, sonicated and then spun down at max speed to remove non-soluble faction and supernatant was saved as nuclear extract. In all western blot analyses, 25 µg of protein from each extract is loaded on gels.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
At least one million cells were stained with desired fluorescently labeled or not antibodies for 1 h on ice. For non-fluorescently labeled antibodies, an additional step of suitable 2° antibodies staining for 30 min on ice as well was performed. In all situations, the cells were analyzed on Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For sorting Moflo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) was used. Data were analyzed with Kaluza Flow Cytometry Analysis Software v 1.2. Each FACS was performed ≥3 times with identical results.

Mammosphere formation assay
One thousand cells transfected with the siRNAs for 72 h or treated with drugs for 24 h were plated in ultra-low binding dishes (Corning) in the recommended medium. Cells were re-transfected with the siRNAs and re-treated with the drugs every second day for the desired timepoint as described in the Result section. Mammospheres were counted and photographed. Each experiment was done in at least triplicates, three separate times.

ELISA analysis of culture medium
Conditioned medium (CM), serum or cell extract dilutions generated in PBS were used to coat PVC wells microtiter plate with antigens in at least triplicates and incubated O/N/4 °C. After washing, none-specific sites were blocked using 5% BSA in PBS/ > 2 h/RT. Diluted primary antibody (determined using pilot experiments) were then incubated for 2 h/RT followed by Horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondaries diluted in blocking buffer, incubated for 1 h/RT. Detection was done using the OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) and measured at 492 nm. All ELISA experiments were done in at least triplicates, three separate times.

Cell invasion assay
Growth factor reduced BD matrigelTM invasion chambers (24 well plate, 8.0 µm, BD BioCoatTM) were used for Matrigel invasion assays. For transendothelial cell migration, we used Millipore kit (ECM558) according to the manufacturer instructions with modifications. None coated Boyden chambers (also 8.0 µm) were coated with a monolayer of HUVEC (~72 h). Pilot experiments showed very few HUVEC cells migrated under the experimental condition we used. Those who did were removed using a swap before adding tumor cells. In all cases, invaded cells were Crystal Violet stained 24 h later, photographed, and counted. Each experiment was done in at least triplicates that were repeated at least three separate times.

In vivo tumorigenicity and treatment
The University of Mississippi Medical Center IACUC committees approved all animal experiments. All experiments were performed per NIH guidelines and regulations. In all experiments, n = 10/cell line/condition of 6–8weeks old anesthetized immune-compromised SCID or Nu/Nu (Harlan) mice were used. For primary (1°) GemOE-orthotopic mammary tumors, we orthotopically injected 5 × 106 Gem9 cells re-suspended in 100 µl HME medium/Matrigel (1:1) using a 27-gauge needle in the second left mammary fat pads (MFPs). Mice on Dox-supplemented drinking water developed tumor 2 months later [25, 26]. Five tumors were used to generate five primaries (1°) geminin-overexpressing tumor cell lines named: Gem197, Gem240, Gem256, Gem257, and Gem270 [27]. For secondary (2°) GemOE-orthotopic mammary tumors and their metastasis, we orthotopically injected 4 × 10−6 Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells re-suspended in 100 µl RPMI/Matrigel (1:1) in the second left MFPs [27, 29]. At a volume of ~0.5 cm3, mice underwent survival surgeries to remove the 2° tumors and then monitored until metastasis developed. At all times, tumors/metastasis were monitored twice weekly by i.p. injection of 100 µl of D-luciferin (15 mg/mL in PBS) and anesthetized mice using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane gas were photographed for luciferase in vivo signals with IVIS machine (Xenogen). Tumor volume was assessed twice weekly by caliper using the formula L.W/2 (L = longest and W = shortest diameter of the tumor). Tumor initiation was defined as the time when tumors were 3 mm in diameter.

Lungs isolated from these mice were processed to generate single cells using standard assay [42]. Briefly, lungs minced and digested with 300 U/ml type 1 A collagenase (Sigma, C2674) and 100 U/ml hyaluronase (Sigma, H3506)/60 min/37 °C [42]. Dissociated cells were passed through a 70-m strainer and plated into 15-cm plates. The cell suspension was FACS sorted for mCherry expression, expanded for up to 2 weeks, and stored until experiments. Mice pre-treated with the drugs described in the Results section (i.e., on day 1) were intracardiac injected with the mCherry cells isolated from the lungs. The treatments continued as indicated until the assay was stopped.

The generation of geminin depleted TNBC cells and GemOE-RFP/GFP cells
The MDA-MB-231-LM2 (aka. MDA231LM) cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing four different GMNN shRNA (ORIGIN, TL304304) or a non-effective scrambled shRNA (i.e., shCtrl, TR30021). After selection, the most effective three shgeminin were used and three different colonies from the shCtrl were used.

The plasmid 7TCG (Addgene) has 7-TCF-mini-promoters driving expression of eGFP, and the SV40 promoter driving the expression of mCherry in the backbone vector pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE [43] was transfected in the cell lines described in the Results section. Although the infection efficiency was ~90%, we chose to FACS sort the mCherry expressing cells. Cells were grown 72 h under serum-free (SF) conditions. The cells were then trypsinized and plated in normal tissue culture dishes (2D) or low binding dishes (3D) in serum-containing media or SF-media containing none, 4 ng/ml Wnt3a, 50 ng/ml RSPO1, 50 ng/ml RSPO2, or 4 ng/ml Wnt3a plus 50 ng/ml RSPO1 or 2 for 24 h in the case of the 2D cultures and a week in the case of the 3D cultures (changed daily).

Fluorescence IHC
IHC was performed as previously described [27, 29]. Briefly, 4 μm paraffin-embedded sections of tumor tissue excised from tumors above were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in PBS. Antigen retrieval for all antibodies was done using sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0)/10 min/95 °C. Slides were blocked with 10% normal serum (2° antibody species) for 1 h/at RT, washed, and probed with 1° antibody ON/4 °C. Slides were exposed to Alexa Fluor 568 (red) and 488 (green) conjugated secondary antibodies 1 h/RT, counterstained and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector) and imaged under the fluorescence microscope.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons of treatment outcomes were tested for statistical differences using the Student t-test for paired data. Additionally, SPSS software was used to perform the ANOVA test followed by a post hoc Bonferroni correction for comparing multiple groups. The association of mRNA transcript expression with various clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed. Statistical significance was assumed at a P value are *≤0.05, **≤0.01, and ***≤0.001.

Results
GemOE worsens breast cancer patients’ outcomes
Kaplan–Meier (K–M) analysis of the TCGA data with a log-rank test [36] revealed that GemOE associates with inferior OS (HR = 1.25, p = 0.04, Fig. 1A), RFS (HR = 1.6, p < 1e−16, Fig. 1B), DMFS (HR = 1.23, p = 0.039, Fig. 1C), and lung metastasis-free survival (LMFS, HR = 1.57, p = 0.049, Fig. 1D) in breast cancer patients. Previously, our immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of ~1000 breast cancer samples showed GemOE mainly in TNBC tumors [26]. K–M analysis identified association between GemOE and inferior RFS in the basal-like 1 (BL-1, HR = 2.09, p = 0.0028, Supplementary Fig. 1A), and to some extent in the immunomodulatory (IM, HR = 1.69, p = 0.082, Supplementary Fig. 1C) tumors, but not the other subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 1D–G) [44].
